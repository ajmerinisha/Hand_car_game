A Python-based car game where you control the car entirely with hand gestures using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pygame. Open your hand to accelerate, close your fist to brake, and move your hand left or right to steer.
This project demonstrates real-time gesture recognition, computer vision, and interactive game development.
